  "I'm considering inviting to my podcast some contributors of the Meaning Crisis Discord server (interested in the ideas of John Vervaeke). \n\nYour task is to identify potential podcast guests based on an extract of a CONVERSATION in this Discord server (provided by the user below).\n\n1) For each participant:\n  1a) Extract the topics they are most knowledgeable about and most curious about.\n  1b) For each of the CRITERIA provided below, first provide your reasoning, then provide the corresponding rating [1-10]. \n  1c) Then compute the weighted scores for the participant. \n2) Finally, recapitulate all the topics, ratings, strengths, weaknesses and weighted score in a table (sorted by score).\n\n## CRITERIA\n\nTo identify the best potential podcast guests from this conversation, please use the following criteria. The weights reflect the importance of each attribute for a successful, engaging, and insightful podcast episode centered on Vervaeke's ideas.\n\n*   **Articulateness & Depth of Thought (Weight: 10):** The single most important factor. Can the person express complex ideas clearly, thoughtfully, and in a compelling way? A podcast is an audio medium, so clarity is paramount.\n*   **Knowledge of Vervaeke's Work (Weight: 9):** How well does the person understand and apply concepts from the Meaning Crisis series (e.g., agent-arena, reciprocal narrowing, dialogos)? This is crucial for staying on-topic.\n*   **Originality & Application (Weight: 8):** Does the person merely repeat Vervaeke's ideas, or do they synthesize them, apply them to new domains, or connect them to personal experiences? This is what makes a conversation unique and valuable.\n*   **Dialogical Skill (Weight: 7):** How well do they engage with others? Do they ask good questions, build on others' points, and listen well? This is key for a conversational podcast format.\n*   **Engagement & Proactivity (Weight: 6):** How active and passionate is the person in the conversation? Do they initiate topics and drive the discussion forward? This suggests they would be an energetic and engaged guest.\n*   **Community & Metacognition (Weight: 4):** How aware is the person of the community's dynamics, history, and purpose? This is a \"nice-to-have\" that can add a rich layer of context to the conversation.\n\n",

  "# INSTRUCTIONS\n\nI'm a indie hacker (i.e. a bootstrapped solopreneur software engineer).\n\nYour task is to brainstorm product concepts based on my initial idea (my first message below), guided by the following STRATEGIC FRAMEWORKS. \n\n---\n\n# STRATEGIC FRAMEWORKS\n\n- ## Introduction\n\t- As an indie hacker, I am the CEO, CTO, marketer, and customer support agent all in one. I don't have a board to impress or VC funding to burn. My most valuable resources are my time, my focus, and my ability to build.\n\t- These frameworks are mental tools to help me make better decisions, faster. They will help me find a profitable problem, build a product people love, find my first paying customers, and create a sustainable business that serves my life, not the other way around.\n- ## Part 1: The Foundation ‚Äì My Mindset & My Offer\n\t- Before I write a single line of code, I must internalize these principles. They define the difference between a hobby project and a business.\n\t- ### 1. Make Something People Want\n\t\t- **Originator:** Paul Graham (Y Combinator)\n\t\t- **Core Idea:** This is the most fundamental startup directive. It's easy to get lost in technology, but none of it matters if I haven't built a product or service that a specific group of people desperately needs or desires. The evidence for this \"want\" shouldn't be what people *say* in surveys, but what they *do* (sign up, pay, use it obsessively, tell their friends).\n\t\t- **Strategic Question for an Indie Hacker:** **What is the strongest evidence I have that a specific group of people will be genuinely unhappy if my product disappears tomorrow?**\n\t- ### 2. Do Things That Don't Scale\n\t\t- **Originator:** Paul Graham (Y Combinator)\n\t\t- **Core Idea:** In the very beginning, I must do manual, unscalable things to acquire my first users and learn from them. This includes personally emailing potential users, providing white-glove onboarding, and manually performing tasks that I'll later automate. This hands-on approach is my superpower; it's how I build a product people actually want and create a core group of evangelists.\n\t\t- **Strategic Question for an Indie Hacker:** **What manual, heroic, and completely unscalable effort can I personally undertake _*this week*_ to delight my first 10 users?**\n\t- ### 3. The Value Equation\n\t\t- **Originator:** Alex Hormozi\n\t\t- **Core Idea:** The value of my offer can be broken down into a four-part equation. My goal is to maximize the top and minimize the bottom. This is how I make my product a \"no-brainer\" purchase.\n\t\t\t- **Value = (Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay x Effort & Sacrifice)**\n\t\t- **Strategic Question for an Indie Hacker:** **How can I radically increase my customer's dream outcome and their belief in achieving it, while simultaneously slashing the time and effort it takes for them to get there with my software?**\n\t- ### 4. The Grand Slam Offer\n\t\t- **Originator:** Alex Hormozi\n\t\t- **Core Idea:** This is the practical application of the Value Equation. A Grand Slam Offer is an offer so good people feel stupid saying no. It's not about being the cheapest; it's about stacking so much value (e.g., templates, personal support, a \"done-for-you\" setup, a strong guarantee) that the price seems insignificant.\n\t\t- **Strategic Question for an Indie Hacker:** **What can I add to my core software (bonuses, guarantees, personal help) to make its perceived value at least 10 times its price?**\n- ## Part 2: Finding My Niche & Defining My Product\n\t- I must not build in a vacuum. I must use these frameworks to find a small, winnable market and understand the real problem I'm solving.\n\t- ### 5. Jobs to be Done (JTBD)\n\t\t- **Name:** Jobs to be Done\n\t\t- **Originator:** Popularized by Clayton Christensen, Tony Ulwick, and others.\n\t\t- **Core Idea:** Customers don't buy products; they \"hire\" them to make progress in their lives‚Äîto get a \"job\" done. This framework shifts focus from user demographics to the underlying motivation, context, and desired outcome. By understanding the \"job,\" I can design a better solution.\n\t\t- **Strategic Question for an Indie Hacker:** **What is the underlying progress my customer is trying to make, and what are the functional, social, and emotional dimensions of the \"job\" they are hiring my software to do?**\n\t- ### 6. Blue Ocean Strategy\n\t\t- **Name:** Blue Ocean Strategy\n\t\t- **Originator:** W. Chan Kim & Ren√©e Mauborgne\n\t\t- **Core Idea:** Instead of competing in crowded, existing markets (\"Red Oceans\"), I should create uncontested market space (\"Blue Oceans\"). As an indie hacker, this means finding a niche so specific that the big players ignore it. I do this by eliminating frustrations the industry takes for granted and adding a simple, novel solution.\n\t\t- **Strategic Question for an Indie Hacker:** **What common frustrations or steps can my product eliminate from an existing workflow, and what unique, simple value can I add that no one else is offering?**\n\t- ### 7. Zero to One (Monopoly Theory)\n\t\t- **Name:** Zero to One\n\t\t- **Originator:** Peter Thiel\n\t\t- **Core Idea:** True innovation is not about competing; it's about creating something entirely new for a specific niche, allowing me to build a \"micro-monopoly.\" My goal is to create a product so uniquely suited to a small group of people that, for them, I am the only choice.\n\t\t- **Strategic Question for an Indie Hacker:** **What valuable product can I build for a specific niche, based on my unique skills and insights, that no one else is building?**\n\t- ### 8. Niche Definition (formerly Category Design)\n\t\t- **Name:** Niche Definition (adapted from Category Design)\n\t\t- **Originator:** Adapted from *Play Bigger*\n\t\t- **Core Idea:** I must not try to be a \"better\" project management tool. Instead, I must define a new, specific niche I can own, like \"The first project management tool for solo podcasters.\" By naming the problem and providing the definitive solution, I become the default choice in my small pond, making competition irrelevant.\n\t\t- **Strategic Question for an Indie Hacker:** **What problem am I solving so uniquely that I can name the solution (e.g., \"Async-first team check-ins\") and become the go-to person for it?**\n- ## Part 3: Building, Launching, and Iterating\n\t- This is where the code meets the customer. These frameworks ensure I build what matters and learn as quickly as possible.\n\t- ### 9. The Lean Startup\n\t\t- **Name:** The Lean Startup\n\t\t- **Originator:** Eric Ries\n\t\t- **Core Idea:** The goal of a startup is to find a sustainable business model by turning assumptions into facts as quickly and cheaply as possible. This is done through a continuous **Build-Measure-Learn** feedback loop. I build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), measure how users respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere. For an indie hacker, this is my entire existence.\n\t\t- **Strategic Question for an Indie Hacker:** **What is my most critical assumption right now, and what is the smallest thing I can build or do to test it with real users?**\n\t- ### 10. Product-Led Growth (PLG)\n\t\t- **Name:** Product-Led Growth\n\t\t- **Originator:** Popularized by firms like OpenView Venture Partners.\n\t\t- **Core Idea:** The product itself is my primary marketing and sales channel. This is the default model for most successful indie businesses. The user journey is self-service, the time-to-value is incredibly short, and the product is so good that it encourages sharing. I must deliver value *before* asking for a credit card.\n\t\t- **Strategic Question for an Indie Hacker:** **How can my product deliver a meaningful \"aha!\" moment to a user within the first five minutes, without them ever needing to talk to me?**\n\t- ### 11. Working Backwards (The Amazon Method)\n\t\t- **Name:** Working Backwards\n\t\t- **Originator:** Amazon\n\t\t- **Core Idea:** Before I build a new feature, I should write the \"launch announcement\" for it‚Äîa simple blog post, tweet, or email to my users. This forces me to articulate the customer benefit clearly from the start. If I can't write a compelling announcement, the feature probably isn't worth building.\n\t\t- **Strategic Question for an Indie Hacker:** **If I had to announce this feature on Twitter tomorrow, what would I say to make people instantly get it and want it?**\n\t- ### 12. The Kano Model\n\t\t- **Name:** The Kano Model\n\t\t- **Originator:** Noriaki Kano\n\t\t- **Core Idea:** A framework for prioritizing features. I must classify them as:\n\t\t\t- **Must-be:** If these are missing, the product is broken (e.g., a \"save\" button).\n\t\t\t- **Performance:** The more I have, the better (e.g., speed).\n\t\t\t- **Delighters:** Unexpected, cool features that make people smile.\n\t\t\t    \n\t\t\t  As a solo dev, I must build all \"Must-bes,\" be good enough on \"Performance,\" and use one or two clever \"Delighters\" to stand out.  \n\t\t- **Strategic Question for an Indie Hacker:** **Which of my planned features is a true \"Delighter\" that will make users talk, and which are just \"Indifferent\" features I can cut to launch faster?**\n- ## Part 4: Finding Customers & Building a Sustainable Business\n\t- I've built it. Now, how do I get paid? These frameworks are about getting traction and creating a business that lasts.\n\t- ### 13. 1,000 True Fans\n\t\t- **Name:** 1,000 True Fans\n\t\t- **Originator:** Kevin Kelly\n\t\t- **Core Idea:** This is the indie hacker manifesto. I don't need millions of users. I only need a core of \"true fans\"‚Äîpeople who will buy anything I produce. If I can build a direct relationship with ~1,000 of these fans and generate $100 profit from each per year, I've built a sustainable $100,000/year business. I must focus on depth of relationship, not breadth of reach.\n\t\t- **Strategic Question for an Indie Hacker:** **How can I build a direct, deep, and recurring relationship with my first 100 users so they become lifelong evangelists?**\n\t- ### 14. Pirate Metrics (AARRR)\n\t\t- **Name:** Pirate Metrics (AARRR)\n\t\t- **Originator:** Dave McClure (500 Startups)\n\t\t- **Core Idea:** My business dashboard. A simple, five-metric framework for understanding my growth funnel and finding the leak.\n\t\t\t- **A**cquisition: How do users find me? (e.g., Twitter, SEO)\n\t\t\t- **A**ctivation: Do they have a great first experience?\n\t\t\t- **R**etention: Do they come back? (This is key for SaaS)\n\t\t\t- **R**eferral: Do they tell others?\n\t\t\t- **R**evenue: Do they pay me?\n\t\t- **Strategic Question for an Indie Hacker:** **Looking at my AARRR funnel, which single metric is the biggest constraint on my profitable growth, and what is one thing I can do this week to improve it?**\n\t- ### 15. Crossing the Chasm\n\t\t- **Name:** Crossing the Chasm\n\t\t- **Originator:** Geoffrey Moore\n\t\t- **Core Idea (Indie Adaptation):** For an indie hacker, the \"chasm\" is the gap between my friends/early supporters and my first *real*, anonymous, paying customers. To cross it, I must focus all my energy on dominating a tiny, specific \"beachhead\" niche. I must prove I can solve the problem for *that one group* perfectly. Their testimonials are the social proof I need to win over the next group.\n\t\t- **Strategic Question for an Indie Hacker:** **What is the single, specific beachhead niche (e.g., 'freelance writers who use Substack') that I can completely own to get my first 10 paying customers who don't know me personally?**\n\t- ### 16. The Long Tail\n\t\t- **Name:** The Long Tail\n\t\t- **Originator:** Chris Anderson\n\t\t- **Core Idea:** The internet allows me to serve niche needs that were previously uneconomical. As an indie hacker, I don't build for the \"hits.\" I build *for* the long tail. My entire business can be a single, valuable, long-tail product that serves a dedicated audience perfectly.\n\t\t- **Strategic Question for an Indie Hacker:** **Is my product serving a passionate, niche community whose needs are too specific for large companies to address?**\n\t- ### 17. 7 Powers (The Indie Hacker's Moat)\n\t\t- **Name:** 7 Powers\n\t\t- **Originator:** Hamilton Helmer\n\t\t- **Core Idea:** How do I prevent someone from cloning my product tomorrow?

Start with a SWOT analysis. Then interpret the situation to pinpoint the core issue (\"What's really going on here?\"). Simplify the complexity to find the crux of the problem or leverage point.\n    * **Guiding Policy:** Define a clear, overarching approach or method for overcoming the challenge identified in the diagnosis. This policy must outline *how* the project will compete or navigate the challenge, making clear choices about the direction and ruling out alternative paths. It should create or leverage some form of advantage. State the general approach, not just goals.\n    * **Coherent Actions:** Detail a set of specific, coordinated, and mutually reinforcing actions, resource commitments, or policy changes required to implement the Guiding Policy. These actions must be concrete, logical, and directly focused on executing the chosen approach. Ensure they are feasible within the likely project constraints.\n\n\n2.  **Consideration of Key Supporting Concepts:** While developing the Kernel, actively consider and integrate (where relevant) the following Rumelt concepts into your analysis and recommendations:\n    * **Focus and Choice:** Emphasize the need for concentration of effort and making difficult choices about what *not* to pursue.\n    * **Leverage:** Identify potential points where focused effort can yield disproportionately large results. How can the strategy exploit asymmetries or unique strengths?\n    * **Proximate Objectives:** If the overall goal is large, define achievable intermediate objectives within the Coherent Actions that build momentum and overcome key parts of the challenge.\n    * **Chain-Link Systems:** Consider if project success depends on a sequence of steps where the weakest link determines overall performance. Does the strategy address potential bottlenecks?\n    * **Using Advantage:** Explicitly consider how the strategy creates, defends, or exploits sources of competitive or situational advantage.\n    * **Dealing with Ambiguity:** Acknowledge uncertainties and briefly suggest how the strategy might adapt or maintain focus amidst change.\n\n\n3.  **Avoidance of Bad Strategy:** Ensure your proposed strategy explicitly avoids the hallmarks of bad strategy:\n    * **No Fluff:** Use clear, precise language. Avoid vague buzzwords or unsubstantiated claims.\n    * **Faces the Challenge:** Directly address the core challenge identified in the Diagnosis.\n    * **Distinguishes Goals from Strategy:** Do not mistake project goals for the strategic approach (the *how*).\n    * **Avoids Bad Strategic Objectives:** Ensure the Coherent Actions are focused and coordinated, not just a disconnected laundry list or overly ambitious/impractical objectives.\n\n\n**Structure your response clearly, addressing each component of the Kernel (Diagnosis, Guiding Policy, Coherent Actions) in detail, while thoughtfully weaving in the Key Supporting Concepts as appropriate.
