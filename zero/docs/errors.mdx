title: Error Handling
---

Errors from mutators and queries are thrown in response to method calls where possible, but many Zero errors occur asynchronously, during sync.

You can catch these errors with the `onError` constructor parameter:

```ts
const z = new Zero({
  upstream: 'https://my-upstream-db.com',
  onError: (msg, ...rest) => {
    reportToSentry('Zero error:', msg, ...rest);
  },
});
```

You can use this to send errors to Sentry, show custom UI, etc.

The first parameter to `onError` is a descriptive message. Additional parameters provide more detail, for example an `Error` object (with a stack), or a JSON object.

<Note>
  If you implement `onError`, errors will no longer be sent to devtools by
  default. If you also want errors sent to the devtools console, you must call
  `console.error()` inside your `onError` handler.
