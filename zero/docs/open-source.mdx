title: Zero is Open Source Software
---

Specifically, the Zero client and server are Apache-2 licensed. You can use, modify, host, and distribute them freely:

## Business Model

We plan to commercialize Zero in the future by offering a hosted `zero-cache` service for people who do not want to run it themselves. We expect to charge prices for this roughly comparable to today's database hosting services. We'll also offer white-glove service to help enterprises run `zero-cache` within their own infrastructure.

These plans may change as we develop Zero further. For example, we may also build closed-source companion software â€“ similar to how Docker, Inc. charges for team access to Docker Desktop.

But we have no plans to ever change the licensing of the core product: We're building a general-purpose sync engine for the entire web, and we can only do that if the core remains completely open.
