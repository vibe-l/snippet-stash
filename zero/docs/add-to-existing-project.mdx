Zero integrates easily into most JavaScript or TypeScript projects, whether
you're using React, Vue, Svelte, Solid, or vanilla JavaScript.

## Prerequisites

- A PostgreSQL database with Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) enabled. See [Connecting
  to Postgres](connecting-to-postgres) for setup instructions.
- If you are using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) ensure that
  [`strictNullChecks`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#strictNullChecks)
  is set to `true` in [tsconfig.json](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/). If this is not set then the advanced types Zero uses do not work
  as expected.

## Installation

Install the Zero package:

```bash
npm install @rocicorp/zero
```

<details>
<summary id="not-npm">Not using npm?</summary>

Zero's server component depends on `@rocicorp/zero-sqlite3`, which contains a
binary that requires running a postinstall script. Most alternative package
managers (non-npm) disable these scripts by default for security reasons. Here's
how to enable installation for common alternatives:

### pnpm

For [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), either:

- Run `pnpm approve-builds` to approve all build scripts, or
- Add the specific dependency to your `package.json`:

```json
"pnpm": {
  "onlyBuiltDependencies": [
    "@rocicorp/zero-sqlite3"
  ]
}
```

### Bun

For [Bun](https://bun.sh/), add the dependency to your trusted dependencies
list:

```json
"trustedDependencies": [
  "@rocicorp/zero-sqlite3"
],
```

</details>

## Environment Variables

Configure Zero by creating a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB="postgresql://user:password@127.0.0.1/postgres"
ZERO_REPLICA_FILE="/tmp/sync-replica.db"
```

Replace the placeholders with your database connection details. For more
options, see [configuration options](zero-cache-config).

## Starting the Server

Start the Zero server using the CLI:

```bash
npx zero-cache-dev
```

The server runs on port 4848 by default. To verify, open `http://localhost:4848`
in your browser. If everything is configured correctly, you'll see "OK".

<Note slug="schema-file-location" heading="Schema file location">
  By default, `zero-cache` looks for a `schema.ts` file in the root of your
  project. You can change this by setting the `ZERO_SCHEMA_PATH` environment
  variable or by providing a `-p --schema-path` flag.
</Note>

## Defining Your Schema

Define your data model schema as described in the [Zero schema
documentation](zero-schema).

Example:

```ts
// schema.ts
import {createSchema, table, string} from '@rocicorp/zero';

const message = table('message')
  .columns({
    id: string(),
    body: string(),
  })
  .primaryKey('id');

export const schema = createSchema({
  tables: [message],
});

export type Schema = typeof schema;
```

If you're using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) or
[Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/), you can convert their schemas to Zero
schemas using tools listed in the [community
section](./community#database-tools).

### Permissions

Update `schema.ts` to include permissions for your tables. For example, to allow
all users to read and write to the `message` table, add the following:

```ts
// schema.ts
import {ANYONE_CAN_DO_ANYTHING, definePermissions} from '@rocicorp/zero';

export const permissions = definePermissions<unknown, Schema>(schema, () => ({
  message: ANYONE_CAN_DO_ANYTHING,
}));
```

For more details, see [permissions](permissions).

## Creating a Zero Instance

To create a Zero client instance:

```js
import {Zero} from '@rocicorp/zero';

const z = new Zero({
  userID: 'anon',
  server: 'http://localhost:4848',
  schema,
});
```

In production, avoid hardcoding the server URL. Use environment variables like
`import.meta.env.VITE_PUBLIC_SERVER` or `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER`.

## Reading Data

To read data, use the `materialize` method on a `Query` from the `Zero`
instance. This creates a materialized view that listens for real-time updates to
the data:

```js
const view = z.query.message.materialize();
view.addListener(data => console.log('Data updated:', data));
```

When the view is no longer needed, ensure you clean up by destroying it:

```js
view.destroy();
```

For more details, see [Reading Data with ZQL](reading-data).

### React

React developers can use the `useZero` hook for seamless integration. See
[Integrations React](react) for more details.

### SolidJS

For SolidJS, use the `createZero` function instead of `new Zero`.

Refer to [Integrations SolidJS](solidjs) for additional information.

### Other Frameworks

For other frameworks, see the [UI frameworks](community#ui-frameworks)
documentation.

## Writing Data

Zero supports both simple and advanced data mutations. For basic use cases,
use the [CRUD mutator](writing-data):

```ts
z.mutate.message.insert({id: nanoid(), body: 'Hello World!'});
```

For more complex scenarios, such as custom business logic, use
[custom mutators](custom-mutators) to define tailored mutation behavior.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Zero does not yet support SSR. See [SSR](zql-on-the-server#ssr) for details on disabling SSR for your framework.

## Deployment

Ensure all `.env` variables are set in the production environment. For Zero
cache deployment, see [Deployment](deployment). For frontend deployment, consult
your framework's documentation.
