title: zero-cache Config
---

`zero-cache` is configured either via CLI flag or environment variable. There is no separate `zero.config` file.

You can also see all available flags by running `zero-cache --help`.

## Required Flags

### Auth

One of [Auth JWK](#auth-jwk), [Auth JWK URL](#auth-jwk-url), or [Auth Secret](#auth-secret) must be specified. See [Authentication](/docs/auth/) for more details.

### Replica File

File path to the SQLite replica that zero-cache maintains. This can be lost, but if it is, zero-cache will have to re-replicate next time it starts up.

flag: `--replica-file`<br/>
env: `ZERO_REPLICA_FILE`<br/>
required: `true`

### Upstream DB

The "upstream" authoritative postgres database. In the future we will support other types of upstream besides PG.

flag: `--upstream-db`<br/>
env: `ZERO_UPSTREAM_DB`<br/>
required: `true`

## Optional Flags

### Admin Password

A password used to administer zero-cache server, for example to access the `/statz` endpoint.

flag: `--admin-password`<br/>
env: `ZERO_ADMIN_PASSWORD`<br/>
required: `false`

### App ID

Unique identifier for the app.

Multiple zero-cache apps can run on a single upstream database, each of which is isolated from the others, with its own permissions, sharding (future feature), and change/cvr databases.

The metadata of an app is stored in an upstream schema with the same name, e.g. `zero`, and the metadata for each app shard, e.g. client and mutation ids, is stored in the `{app-id}_{#}` schema. (Currently there is only a single "0" shard, but this will change with sharding).

The CVR and Change data are managed in schemas named `{app-id}_{shard-num}/cvr` and `{app-id}_{shard-num}/cdc`, respectively, allowing multiple apps and shards to share the same database instance (e.g. a Postgres "cluster") for CVR and Change management.

Due to constraints on replication slot names, an App ID may only consist of lower-case letters, numbers, and the underscore character.

Note that this option is used by both `zero-cache` and `zero-deploy-permissions`.

flag: `--app-id`<br/>
env: `ZERO_APP_ID`<br/>
default: `zero`

### App Publications

Postgres PUBLICATIONs that define the tables and columns to replicate. Publication names may not begin with an underscore, as zero reserves that prefix for internal use.

If unspecified, zero-cache will create and use an internal publication that publishes all tables in the public schema, i.e.:

```
CREATE PUBLICATION _{app-id}_public_0 FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA public;
```

Note that once an app has begun syncing data, this list of publications cannot be changed, and zero-cache will refuse to start if a specified value differs from what was originally synced. To use a different set of publications, a new app should be created.

flag: `--app-publications`<br/>
env: `ZERO_APP_PUBLICATIONS`<br/>
default: `[]`

### Auth JWK

A public key in JWK format used to verify JWTs. Only one of jwk, jwksUrl and secret may be set.

flag: `--auth-jwk`<br/>
env: `ZERO_AUTH_JWK`<br/>
required: `false`

### Auth JWK URL

A URL that returns a JWK set used to verify JWTs. Only one of jwk, jwksUrl and secret may be set.

flag: `--auth-jwks-url`<br/>
env: `ZERO_AUTH_JWKS_URL`<br/>
required: `false`

### Auto Reset

Automatically wipe and resync the replica when replication is halted. This situation can occur for configurations in which the upstream database provider prohibits event trigger creation, preventing the zero-cache from being able to correctly replicate schema changes. For such configurations, an upstream schema change will instead result in halting replication with an error indicating that the replica needs to be reset. When auto-reset is enabled, zero-cache will respond to such situations by shutting down, and when restarted, resetting the replica and all synced clients. This is a heavy-weight operation and can result in user-visible slowness or downtime if compute resources are scarce.

flag: `--auto-reset`<br/>
env: `ZERO_AUTO_RESET`<br/>
default: `true`

### Auth Secret

A symmetric key used to verify JWTs. Only one of jwk, jwksUrl and secret may be set.

flag: `--auth-secret`<br/>
env: `ZERO_AUTH_SECRET`<br/>
required: `false`

### Change DB

The Postgres database used to store recent replication log entries, in order to sync multiple view-syncers without requiring multiple replication slots on the upstream database. If unspecified, the upstream-db will be used.

flag: `--change-db`<br/>
env: `ZERO_CHANGE_DB`<br/>
required: `false`

### Change Max Connections

The maximum number of connections to open to the change database. This is used by the change-streamer for catching up zero-cache replication subscriptions.

flag: `--change-max-conns`<br/>
env: `ZERO_CHANGE_MAX_CONNS`<br/>
default: `5`

### Change Streamer Mode

The mode for running or connecting to the change-streamer:

- `dedicated`: runs the change-streamer and shuts down when another
  change-streamer takes over the replication slot. This is appropriate in a
  single-node configuration, or for the replication-manager in a
  multi-node configuration.
- `discover`: connects to the change-streamer as internally advertised in the
  change-db. This is appropriate for the view-syncers in a multi-node

flag: `--change-streamer-mode`<br/>
env: `ZERO_CHANGE_STREAMER_MODE`<br/>
default: `dedicated`

### Change Streamer Port

The port on which the change-streamer runs. This is an internal protocol between the replication-manager and zero-cache, which runs in the same process in local development. If unspecified, defaults to --port + 1.

flag: `--change-streamer-port`<br/>
env: `ZERO_CHANGE_STREAMER_PORT`<br/>
required: `false`

### Change Streamer URI

When unset, the zero-cache runs its own replication-manager (i.e. change-streamer). In production, this should be set to the replication-manager URI, which runs a change-streamer on port 4849.

flag: `--change-streamer-uri`<br/>
env: `ZERO_CHANGE_STREAMER_URI`<br/>
required: `false`


### CVR DB

The Postgres database used to store CVRs. CVRs (client view records) keep track of the data synced to clients in order to determine the diff to send on reconnect. If unspecified, the upstream-db will be used.

flag: `--cvr-db`<br/>
env: `ZERO_CVR_DB`<br/>
required: `false`

### CVR Max Connections

The maximum number of connections to open to the CVR database. This is divided evenly amongst sync workers.

Note that this number must allow for at least one connection per sync worker, or zero-cache will fail to start. See num-sync-workers.

flag: `--cvr-max-conns`<br/>
env: `ZERO_CVR_MAX_CONNS`<br/>
default: `30`

### Enable Telemetry

Zero collects anonymous telemetry data to help us understand usage. We collect:

- Zero version
- Uptime
- General machine information, like the number of CPUs, OS, CI/CD environment, etc.
- Information about usage, such as number of queries or mutations processed per hour.

This is completely optional and can be disabled at any time. You can also opt-out by setting [`DO_NOT_TRACK=1`](https://consoledonottrack.com/).

flag: `--enable-telemetry`<br/>
env: `ZERO_ENABLE_TELEMETRY`<br/>
default: `true`

### Initial Sync Table Copy Workers

The number of parallel workers used to copy tables during initial sync. Each worker copies a single table at a time, fetching rows in batches of `initial-sync-row-batch-size`.

flag: `--initial-sync-table-copy-workers`<br/>
env: `ZERO_INITIAL_SYNC_TABLE_COPY_WORKERS`<br/>
default: `5`

### Lazy Startup

Delay starting the majority of zero-cache until first request.

This is mainly intended to avoid connecting to Postgres replication stream until the first request is received, which can be useful i.e., for preview instances.

Currently only supported in single-node mode.

flag: `--lazy-startup`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LAZY_STARTUP`<br/>
default: `false`

### Litestream Backup URL

The location of the litestream backup, usually an s3:// URL. This is only consulted by the replication-manager. view-syncers receive this information from the replication-manager.

flag: `--litestream-backup-url`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LITESTREAM_BACKUP_URL`<br/>
required: `false`

### Litestream Checkpoint Threshold MB

The size of the WAL file at which to perform an SQlite checkpoint to apply the writes in the WAL to the main database file. Each checkpoint creates a new WAL segment file that will be backed up by litestream. Smaller thresholds may improve read performance, at the expense of creating more files to download when restoring the replica from the backup.

flag: `--litestream-checkpoint-threshold-mb`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LITESTREAM_CHECKPOINT_THRESHOLD_MB`<br/>
default: `40`

### Litestream Config Path

Path to the litestream yaml config file. zero-cache will run this with its environment variables, which can be referenced in the file via `${ENV}` substitution, for example:

- ZERO_REPLICA_FILE for the db Path
- ZERO_LITESTREAM_BACKUP_LOCATION for the db replica url
- ZERO_LITESTREAM_LOG_LEVEL for the log Level
- ZERO_LOG_FORMAT for the log type

flag: `--litestream-config-path`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LITESTREAM_CONFIG_PATH`<br/>
default: `./src/services/litestream/config.yml`

### Litestream Executable

Path to the litestream executable. This option has no effect if litestream-backup-url is unspecified.

flag: `--litestream-executable`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LITESTREAM_EXECUTABLE`<br/>
required: `false`

### Litestream Incremental Backup Interval Minutes

The interval between incremental backups of the replica. Shorter intervals reduce the amount of change history that needs to be replayed when catching up a new view-syncer, at the expense of increasing the number of files needed to download for the initial litestream restore.

flag: `--litestream-incremental-backup-interval-minutes`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LITESTREAM_INCREMENTAL_BACKUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES`<br/>
default: `15`


### Litestream Multipart Concurrency

The number of parts (of size --litestream-multipart-size bytes) to upload or download in parallel when backing up or restoring the snapshot.

flag: `--litestream-multipart-concurrency`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LITESTREAM_MULTIPART_CONCURRENCY`<br/>
default: `48`

### Litestream Multipart Size

The size of each part when uploading or downloading the snapshot with
`--litestream-multipart-concurrency`. Note that up to concurrency * size
bytes of memory are used when backing up or restoring the snapshot.

flag: `--litestream-multipart-size`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LITESTREAM_MULTIPART_SIZE`<br/>
default: `16777216` (16 MiB)

### Litestream Log Level

flag: `--litestream-log-level`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LITESTREAM_LOG_LEVEL`<br/>
default: `warn`
values: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`

### Litestream Port

Port on which litestream exports metrics, used to determine the replication
watermark up to which it is safe to purge change log records.

flag: `--litestream-port`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LITESTREAM_PORT`<br/>
default: `--port + 2`

### Litestream Restore Parallelism

The number of WAL files to download in parallel when performing the initial restore of the replica from the backup.

flag: `--litestream-restore-parallelism`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LITESTREAM_RESTORE_PARALLELISM`<br/>
default: `48`

### Litestream Snapshot Backup Interval Hours

The interval between snapshot backups of the replica. Snapshot backups make a full copy of the database to a new litestream generation. This improves restore time at the expense of bandwidth. Applications with a large database and low write rate can increase this interval to reduce network usage for backups (litestream defaults to 24 hours).

flag: `--litestream-snapshot-backup-interval-hours`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LITESTREAM_SNAPSHOT_BACKUP_INTERVAL_HOURS`<br/>
default: `12`

### Log Format

Use text for developer-friendly console logging and json for consumption by structured-logging services.

flag: `--log-format`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LOG_FORMAT`<br/>
default: `"text"`<br/>
values: `text`, `json`

### Log IVM Sampling

How often to collect IVM metrics. 1 out of N requests will be sampled where N is this value.

flag: `--log-ivm-sampling`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LOG_IVM_SAMPLING`<br/>
default: `5000`

### Log Level

Sets the logging level for the application.

flag: `--log-level`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LOG_LEVEL`<br/>
default: `"info"`<br/>
values: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`

### Log Slow Hydrate Threshold

The number of milliseconds a query hydration must take to print a slow warning.

flag: `--log-slow-hydrate-threshold`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LOG_SLOW_HYDRATE_THRESHOLD`<br/>
default: `100`

### Log Slow Row Threshold

The number of ms a row must take to fetch from table-source before it is considered slow.

flag: `--log-slow-row-threshold`<br/>
env: `ZERO_LOG_SLOW_ROW_THRESHOLD`<br/>
default: `2`

### Number of Sync Workers

The number of processes to use for view syncing. Leave this unset to use the maximum available parallelism. If set to 0, the server runs without sync workers, which is the configuration for running the replication-manager.

flag: `--num-sync-workers`<br/>
env: `ZERO_NUM_SYNC_WORKERS`<br/>
required: `false`

### Per User Mutation Limit Max

The maximum mutations per user within the specified windowMs.

flag: `--per-user-mutation-limit-max`<br/>
env: `ZERO_PER_USER_MUTATION_LIMIT_MAX`<br/>
required: `false`

### Per User Mutation Limit Window (ms)

The sliding window over which the perUserMutationLimitMax is enforced.

flag: `--per-user-mutation-limit-window-ms`<br/>
env: `ZERO_PER_USER_MUTATION_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`<br/>
default: `60000`

### Port

The port for sync connections.

flag: `--port`<br/>
env: `ZERO_PORT`<br/>
default: `4848`

### Push API Key

An optional secret used to authorize zero-cache to call the API server handling writes.

flag: `--push-api-key`<br/>
env: `ZERO_PUSH_API_KEY`<br/>
required: `false`

### Push Forward Cookies

If true, zero-cache will forward cookies from the request. This is useful for passing authentication cookies to the API server. If false, cookies are not forwarded.

flag: `--push-forward-cookies`<br/>
env: `ZERO_PUSH_FORWARD_COOKIES`<br/>
default: `false`

### Push URL

The URL of the API server to which zero-cache will push custom mutations.

Can also be a pattern, or set of patterns, which is used in conjunction with the `push.url` parameter of the `Zero` constructor. In this case, the pattern specifies the URLs which Zero will allow the constructor to specify.

Examples:

* `https://*.example.com` matches `https://api.example.com` and `https://www.example.com`
* `https://*.example.com` does not match `https://example.com` (no subdomain)
* `https://*.example.com` does not match `https://api.example.com/path` (no trailing path)
* `https://*.*.example.com` matches `https://api.v1.example.com` and `https://www.v2.example.com`
* `https://*.*.example.com` does not match `https://api.example.com` (only one subdomain)

Currently, wildcards are only allowed for subdomains.

flag: `--push-url`<br/>
env: `ZERO_PUSH_URL`<br/>
required: `false`

### Query Hydration Stats

Track and log the number of rows considered by query hydrations which take longer than **log-slow-hydrate-threshold** milliseconds.

This is useful for debugging and performance tuning.

flag: `--query-hydration-stats`<br/>
env: `ZERO_QUERY_HYDRATION_STATS`<br/>
required: `false`

### Replica Vacuum Interval Hours

Performs a VACUUM at server startup if the specified number of hours has elapsed since the last VACUUM (or initial-sync). The VACUUM operation is heavyweight and requires double the size of the db in disk space. If unspecified, VACUUM operations are not performed.

flag: `--replica-vacuum-interval-hours`<br/>
env: `ZERO_REPLICA_VACUUM_INTERVAL_HOURS`<br/>
required: `false`

### Server Version

The version string outputted to logs when the server starts up.

flag: `--server-version`<br/>
env: `ZERO_SERVER_VERSION`<br/>
required: `false`

### Storage DB Temp Dir

Temporary directory for IVM operator storage. Leave unset to use `os.tmpdir()`.

flag: `--storage-db-tmp-dir`<br/>
env: `ZERO_STORAGE_DB_TMP_DIR`<br/>
required: `false`

### Task ID

Globally unique identifier for the zero-cache instance. Setting this to a platform specific task identifier can be useful for debugging. If unspecified, zero-cache will attempt to extract the TaskARN if run from within an AWS ECS container, and otherwise use a random string.

flag: `--task-id`<br/>
env: `ZERO_TASK_ID`<br/>
required: `false`

### Upstream Max Connections

The maximum number of connections to open to the upstream database for committing mutations. This is divided evenly amongst sync workers. In addition to this number, zero-cache uses one connection for the replication stream.

Note that this number must allow for at least one connection per sync worker, or zero-cache will fail to start. See num-sync-workers.

flag: `--upstream-max-conns`<br/>
env: `ZERO_UPSTREAM_MAX_CONNS`<br/>
default: `20`
