title: Quickstart
---

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Node 20+

<Note type="note" slug="other-frameworks">
  This quickstart uses React, but we also have [one available for SolidJS](/docs/solidjs).
</Note>

## Run

First, install and start a Postgres database:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero.git
cd hello-zero
npm install

npm run dev:db-up
```

In a separate terminal, start `zero-cache`:

```bash
cd hello-zero
npm run dev:zero-cache
```

In a final terminal, start the application:

```bash
cd hello-zero
npm run dev:ui
```

## Quick Overview

`hello-zero` is a demo app that allows querying over a small dataset of fake messages between early Zero users.

Here are some things to try:

- Press the **Add Messages** button to add messages to the UI. Any logged-in or anonymous users are allowed to add messages.
- Press the **Remove Messages** button to remove messages. Only logged-in users are allowed to remove messages. You can **hold shift** to bypass the UI warning and see that write access control is being enforced server-side – the UI flickers as the optimistic write happens instantly and is then reverted by the server. Press **login** to login as a random user, then the remove button will work.
- Open two different browsers and see how fast sync propagates changes.
- Add a filter using the **From** and **Contains** controls. Notice that filters are fully dynamic and synced.
- Edit a message by pressing the **pencil icon**. You can only edit messages from the user you’re logged in as. Similar to the remove button, you can attempt to bypass by holding shift.
- Check out the SQL schema for this database in `seed.sql`.
- Login to the database with `psql postgresql://user:password@127.0.0.1:5430/postgres` (or any other pg viewer) and delete or alter a row. Observe that it deletes from UI automatically.

## Deployment

You can deploy Zero apps to most cloud providers that support Docker and Postgres. See [Deployment](/docs/deployment) for more information.
