title: Debugging Permissions
---

Given that permissions are defined in their own file and internally applied to queries, it might be hard to figure out if or why a permission check is failing.

## Read Permissions

You can use the `analyze-query` utility with the `--apply-permissions` flag to see the complete query Zero runs, including read permissions.

```bash
npx analyze-query
  --schema-path='./shared/schema.ts'
  --query='issue.related("comments")'
  --apply-permissions
  --auth-data='{"userId":"user-123"}'
```

If the result looks right, the problem may be that Zero is not receiving the `AuthData` that you think it is. You can retrieve a query hash from websocket or server logs, then ask Zero for the details on that specific query.

Run this command with the same environment you run `zero-cache` with. It will use your `upstream` or `cvr` configuration to look up the query hash in the cvr database.

```bash
npx analyze-query
  --schema-path='./shared/schema.ts'
  --hash='3rhuw19xt9vry'
  --apply-permissions
  --auth-data='{"userId":"user-123"}'
```

<Note type="note" slug="decompilation">
  The printed query can be different than the source ZQL string, because it is
  rebuilt from the query AST. But it should be logically equivalent to the query
  you wrote.
</Note>

## Write Permissions

Look for a `WARN` level log in the output from `zero-cache` like this:

```
Permission check failed for {"op":"update","tableName":"message",...}, action update, phase preMutation, authData: {...}, rowPolicies: [...], cellPolicies: []
```

Zero prints the row, auth data, and permission policies that was applied to any failed writes.

<Note slug="ast-format">
  The ZQL query is printed in AST format. See [Query ASTs](./query-asts) to
  convert it to a more readable format.
