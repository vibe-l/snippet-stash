title: Inspector API
---

The Zero instance provides an API to gather information about the client's current state, such as:

- All active queries
- Query TTL
- Active clients
- Client database contents

This can help figuring out why you hit loading states, how many queries are active at a time, if you have any resource leaks due to failing to clean up queries or if expected data is missing on the client.

## Creating an Inspector

Each `Zero` instance has an `inspect` method that will return the inspector. The `inspect` method is asynchronous because it performs lazy loading of inspect-only related code.

For convenience, the active `Zero` instance is automatically exposed at `__zero`, so you can access the inspector in the console like this:

```ts
const inspector = await __zero.inspect();
```

<Note type="warning" slug="code-splitting">
  Ensure that code splitting is enabled when bundling your app to prevent
  loading inspect-related code by default. The `inspect` API is intended for
  debugging purposes only and should not be used in production applications. It
  is not efficient and communicates directly with the zero-cache via RPC over a
  web socket.

If you are using React, you can use
[`React.lazy`](https://react.dev/reference/react/lazy) to dynamically load
components that depend on the `inspect` API.

</Note>

Once you have an inspector you can inspect the current client and client group.

<Note heading="Clients and Client Groups">
  The client group represents a web browser profile. A client represents an
  instance of `Zero` within that profile. If a user has Chrome open with 5
  different tabs, each with one `Zero` instance, there will be 1 client group
  and 5 clients.
</Note>

For example to see active queries for the current client:

```ts
console.table(await inspector.client.queries());
```

To inspect other clients within the group:

```ts
const allClients = await inspector.clients();
```

## Dumping Data

In addition to information about queries, you can see the contents of the client side database.

```ts
const inspector = await zero.inspect();
const client = inspector.client;

// All raw k/v data currently synced to client
console.log('client map:');
console.log(await client.map());

// kv table extracted into tables
// This is same info that is in z.query[tableName].run()
for (const tableName of Object.keys(schema.tables)) {
  console.log(`table ${tableName}:`);
  console.table(await client.rows(tableName));
}
```
