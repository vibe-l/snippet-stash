title: Zero Schema
---

Zero applications have both a _database schema_ (the normal backend database schema that all web apps have) and a _Zero schema_. The purpose of the Zero schema is to:

1. Provide typesafety for ZQL queries
2. Define first-class relationships between tables
3. Define permissions for access control

  [Community-contributed converters](/docs/community#database-tools) exist for
  Prisma and Drizzle that generate the tables and relationships. It is good to
  know how the underlying Zero schemas work, however, for debugging and
  conceptual understanding.
</Note>

This page describes using the schema to define your tables, columns, and relationships.

## Defining the Zero Schema

The Zero schema is encoded in a TypeScript file that is conventionally named `schema.ts`. For example, see [the schema file for `hello-zero`](https://github.com/rocicorp/hello-zero/blob/main/src/schema.ts).

## Table Schemas

Use the `table` function to define each table in your Zero schema:

```tsx
import {table, string, boolean} from '@rocicorp/zero';

const user = table('user')
  .columns({
    id: string(),
    name: string(),
    partner: boolean(),
  })
  .primaryKey('id');
```

Column types are defined with the `boolean()`, `number()`, `string()`, `json()`, and `enumeration()` helpers. See [Column Types](/docs/postgres-support#column-types) for how database types are mapped to these types.

<Note type="warning" slug="type-mismatches">
  Currently, if the database type doesn’t map correctly to the Zero type,
  replication will continue and succeed but the data won't match the TypeScript
  type. This is a bug – in the future, this will be an error. See
  https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3112.
</Note>

### Name Mapping

Use `from()` to map a TypeScript table or column name to a different database name:

```ts
const userPref = table('userPref')
  // Map TS "userPref" to DB name "user_pref"
  .from('user_pref')
  .columns({
    id: string(),
    // Map TS "orgID" to DB name "org_id"
    orgID: string().from('org_id'),
  });
```

### Multiple Schemas

You can also use `from()` to access other Postgres schemas:

```ts
// Sync the "event" table from the "analytics" schema.
const event = table('event').from('analytics.event');
```

### Optional Columns

Columns can be marked _optional_. This corresponds to the SQL concept `nullable`.

```tsx
const user = table('user')
  .columns({
    id: string(),
    name: string(),
    nickName: string().optional(),
  })
  .primaryKey('id');
```

An optional column can store a value of the specified type or `null` to mean _no value_.

<Note type="note" heading="Null and undefined">
    Note that `null` and `undefined` mean different things when working with Zero rows.

    - When reading, if a column is `optional`, Zero can return `null` for that field. `undefined` is not used at all when Reading from Zero.
    - When writing, you can specify `null` for an optional field to explicitly write `null` to the datastore, unsetting any previous value.
    - For `create` and `upsert` you can set optional fields to `undefined` (or leave the field off completely) to take the default value as specified by backend schema for that column. For `update` you can set any non-PK field to `undefined` to leave the previous value unmodified.

</Note>

### Enumerations

Use the `enumeration` helper to define a column that can only take on a specific set of values. This is most often used alongside an [`enum` Postgres column type](/docs/postgres-support#column-types).

```tsx
import {table, string, enumeration} from '@rocicorp/zero';

const user = table('user')
  .columns({
    id: string(),
    name: string(),
    mood: enumeration<'happy' | 'sad' | 'taco'>(),
  })
  .primaryKey('id');
```

### Custom JSON Types

Use the `json` helper to define a column that stores a JSON-compatible value:

```tsx
import {table, string, json} from '@rocicorp/zero';

const user = table('user')
  .columns({
    id: string(),
    name: string(),
    settings: json<{theme: 'light' | 'dark'}>(),
  })
  .primaryKey('id');
```

### Compound Primary Keys

Pass multiple columns to `primaryKey` to define a compound primary key:

```ts
const user = table('user')
  .columns({
    orgID: string(),
    userID: string(),
    name: string(),
  })
  .primaryKey('orgID', 'userID');
```

## Relationships

Use the `relationships` function to define relationships between tables. Use the `one` and `many` helpers to define singular and plural relationships, respectively:

```ts
const messageRelationships = relationships(message, ({one, many}) => ({
  sender: one({
    sourceField: ['senderID'],
    destField: ['id'],
    destSchema: user,
  }),
  replies: many({
    sourceField: ['id'],
    destSchema: message,
    destField: ['parentMessageID'],
  }),
}));
```

This creates "sender" and "replies" relationships that can later be queried with the [`related` ZQL clause](/docs/reading-data#relationships):

```ts
const messagesWithSenderAndReplies = z.query.messages
  .related('sender')
  .related('replies');
```

This will return an object for each message row. Each message will have a `sender` field that is a single `User` object or `null`, and a `replies` field that is an array of `Message` objects.

### Many-to-Many Relationships

You can create many-to-many relationships by chaining the relationship definitions. Assuming `issue` and `label` tables, along with an `issueLabel` junction table, you can define a `labels` relationship like this:

```ts
const issueRelationships = relationships(issue, ({many}) => ({
  labels: many(
    {
      sourceField: ['id'],
      destSchema: issueLabel,
      destField: ['issueID'],
    },
    {
      sourceField: ['labelID'],
      destSchema: label,
      destField: ['id'],
    },
  ),
}));
```

<Note slug="chain-limit" heading="Only two levels of chaining are supported">
  See https://bugs.rocicorp.dev/issue/3454.
</Note>

### Compound Keys Relationships

Relationships can traverse compound keys. Imagine a `user` table with a compound primary key of `orgID` and `userID`, and a `message` table with a related `senderOrgID` and `senderUserID`. This can be represented in your schema with:

```ts
const messageRelationships = relationships(message, ({one}) => ({
  sender: one({
    sourceField: ['senderOrgID', 'senderUserID'],
    destSchema: user,
    destField: ['orgID', 'userID'],
  }),
}));
```

### Circular Relationships

Circular relationships are fully supported:

```tsx
const commentRelationships = relationships(comment, ({one}) => ({
  parent: one({
    sourceField: ['parentID'],
    destSchema: comment,
    destField: ['id'],
  }),
}));
```

## Database Schemas

Use `createSchema` to define the entire Zero schema:

```tsx
import {createSchema} from '@rocicorp/zero';

export const schema = createSchema({
  tables: [user, medium, message],
  relationships: [userRelationships, mediumRelationships, messageRelationships],
});
```

## Migrations

Zero uses TypeScript-style structural typing to detect schema changes and implement smooth migrations.

### How it Works

When the Zero client connects to `zero-cache` it sends a copy of the schema it was constructed with. `zero-cache` compares this schema to the one it has, and rejects the connection with a special error code if the schema is incompatible.

By default, the Zero client handles this error code by calling `location.reload()`. The intent is to request a newer version of the app that has been updated to handle the new server schema.

<Note type="note" heading="Update Order">
It's important to update the database schema first, then the app. Otherwise a reload loop will occur.

If a reload loop does occur, Zero uses exponential backoff to avoid overloading the server.

</Note>

If you want to change or delay this reload, you can do so by providing the `onUpdateNeeded` constructor parameter:

```ts
const z = new Zero({
  onUpdateNeeded: updateReason => {
    if (reason.type === 'SchemaVersionNotSupported') {
      // Do something custom here, like show a banner.
      // When you're ready, call `location.reload()`.
    }
  },
});
```

If the schema changes in a compatible way while a client is running, `zero-cache` syncs the schema change to the client so that it's ready when the app reloads. 

If the schema changes in an incompatible way while a client is running, `zero-cache` will close the client connection with the same error code as above.

### Schema Change Process

Like other database-backed applications, Zero schema migrations generally follow an “expand/migrate/contract” pattern:

1. Implement and run an “expand” migration on the backend that is backwards compatible with existing schemas. Add new rows, tables, as well as any defaults and triggers needed for backwards compatibility.
2. Add any new permissions required for the new tables/columns by running [`zero-deploy-permissions`](/docs/permissions#permission-deployment).
3. Update and deploy the client app to use the new schema.
4. Optionally, after some grace period, implement and run a “contract” migration on the backend, deleting any obsolete rows/tables.

Steps 1-3 can generally be done as part of a single deploy in your CI pipeline, but step 4 should be weeks later, when most open clients have refreshed the application.
