<Note type="warning" emoji="ðŸš§" heading="Zero is in Alpha">
Zero is a new sync engine based on a novel streaming query engine. This is an ambitious project at an early stage.

You will encounter bugs. You may encounter pathologically slow queries. You are likely to encounter situations where ZQL is not powerful enough to express the
query you want.

That said, we are building Zero live. It has been running [our own bug tracker](https://zbugs.rocicorp.dev) for months, and is used in production by a small set of customer applications that are an extremely good fit.

This page describes the current state of Zero at a high level. To understand whether Zero makes sense for you, please also see [When to Use Zero](./when-to-use).

## Platforms and Frameworks

* [React](./react) and [SolidJS](./solidjs) are fully-supported
* [Svelte and Vue](community) have community support
* React Native is not supported yet, but is [planned](roadmap)

## Databases

* Most Postgres providers [are supported](connecting-to-postgres)
* [Drizzle and Prisma](community) have high-quality community-supported integrations

## Query Language

* Filters, sorts, limits, relationships, and `exists` [are supported](./reading-data).
* Queries can have [`ttl`](reading-data#background-queries) to keep data synced across sessions.
* Zero will stay within a (configurable) client-side [row limit using LRU](reading-data#client-capacity-management).
* [Aggregates](roadmap) (count, min, max, group-by) are not yet supported.
* [Full-text search](roadmap) is not yet supported (you can sometimes simulate with `ILIKE`, though it scales linearly).
* Infinite/virtual scroll is possible, but not easy or optimal.

## Performance

* We do not have a query analyzer, and do not do any join reordering. It's sometimes, but not always possible to manually reorder. Because of this, some queries (especially `exists`) can be pathological. We are actively working on this.
* Every query is a hybrid query. We haven't yet implemented "client-only" queries, meaning patterns like typeahead search can easily crush the server if the query is expensive.
* We have basic CLI tools to understand query performance, but we lack a full-featured inspector to understand at a glance what queries are open or slow.
* We share queries within a "client group" (e.g. all tabs in a browser), but not across groups. This means that if you have many users doing the same query, they will duplicate all that work server-side.

## Miscellaneous

* We do not have a way to limit queries to only expected/allowed forms ([in progress](roadmap)).
* We do not have a good way to support previews (in progress).
* Running Zero requires [deploying it yourself](deployment) to AWS or similar. Running in a [multinode](deployment#guide-multi-node-on-sstaws), zero-downtime way is possible (we do it for zbugs), but significant effort. Running [single node](deployment#guide-single-node-on-flyio) is easier, but updating the server takes it down for a minute or so (we are working on a SaaS solution).
