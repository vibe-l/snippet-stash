title: Welcome to Zero Alpha

Zero is a new kind of [sync engine](/docs/sync) powered by queries.

Rather than syncing entire tables to the client, or using static rules to carefully specify what to sync, you just write queries directly in your client code. Queries can access the entire backend database.

Zero caches the data for queries locally on the device, and reuses that data automatically to answer future queries whenever possible.

For typical applications, almost all queries are instantly resolved with local data. It feels like you have access to the entire backend database directly from the client in memory. Occasionally, when you do a more specific query, Zero falls back to the server. But this happens automatically without any extra work required.

Zero is made possible by a custom streaming query engine we built called [ZQL](/docs/reading-data), which uses [Incremental View Maintenance](https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol16/p1601-budiu.pdf) on both client and server to efficiently keep large, complex queries up to date.
